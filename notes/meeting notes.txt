	- include in appendix nr of speeches per speaker or a graph of speakers vs years?
	- bucketing could be for how many speakers start speaking in a range?
	- 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60 secs, entire debate
	- detect voice activity while extracting VP?
	- keep track for VP:
		- length
		- range (timestamps) where extracted
	- first compare within age-range and w/ different speakers
	- soft-clustering
	- use chat-gpt for brainstorming

	- summary: what I'm gonna do, what is my contribution/identify niche. show I can identify relevant RQs. Say it's at the beginning. More like a research proposal. Section about expected results, hypotheses, how I could interpret the results, "this is what I'm doing cuz I want to learn this"
