Rafal:
	- include in appendix nr of speeches per speaker or a graph of speakers vs years?
	- bucketing could be for how many speakers start speaking in a range?
	- 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60 secs, entire debate
	- detect voice activity while extracting VP?
	- keep track for VP:
		- length
		- range (timestamps) where extracted
	- first compare within age-range and w/ different speakers
	- soft-clustering
	- use chat-gpt for brainstorming
	- tsne with bucketed, set perplexity/number-of-neightbours
	- take politicians A & B, are they more similar within an age vs at different ages?
		- speakers within age ranges vs speakers across age ranges

Sara:
	- motivation, how related to other fields n stuff, position yourself, RQs, what am I doing, main results
	- background = Related Work, *not* mine
	- motivation for why processing was done in a certain way
	- gender and across age comparisons for different speakers
	- compute threshold for a subset of speakers
	- compute threshold from bigger group based on at least 3 speeches per year, separate from current group
