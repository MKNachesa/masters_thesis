Wrong speaker, way wrong start (nr_speech_segments=3) (not contained in final df_filt)

nr_speech_segments:
	1: 52012 cases
	2: 810 cases, 1 really wrong

		- most have a sec (few secs) before jumping to the right speaker
	3: 71 cases, 6 good, 1 wrong, but then like REALLY wrong
		- https://www.riksdagen.se/views/pages/embedpage.aspx?did=GR01SFU15&start=2347.9959375&end=3360.1753125000005, issue is some of the audio is missing. However, this file also has a low overlap_ratio (0.61313). Length ratio = 1.217586
	4: 1 case, not a problem
