- emotion classification from voiceprint
	- if good: nice!
	- if not: stable across emotions!
	- do this first (before seeing if different emotions compete with recognising people through voiceprints)!
	- on uppmax	
	- use R&D as baseline
- check if result same for VPs of 30 secs vs 5 mins
- mention that research is in swedish so age on voice might not apply the same!
	- my research is so inclusive and debiasing :)
- draw my own plots for F0?
- visualise with t-SNE
- how to combine multiple voiceprints?
	- should VP contribution be based on length of file?
		- maybe only if files very short
	- if yes, should this follow a linear or other scale?
- selecting speakers
	- speakers per bucket dropping
- selecting pairs
	- take embedding from the middle of age range
	- but also compare edge-cases (so does vp at 19 compare to vp at 29?)
- stuff that doesn't affect VPs (read about it)
	- silences
	- noise (like papers)
- My section on age-effects on the voice do not cover changes due to disease, such as parkinson's disease
- What are the recording settings @riksdagen like/what is the sound recording like
