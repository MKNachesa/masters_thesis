is it normal that even if link contains an end, the vid doesn't stop there?

start/end_text_time has 801 NaNs, is this correct?

sometimes politicians take pauses when speaking. Does the voiceprint thing account for that?

debates having wrong starts: 4 (sometimes quite a lot)
debates having wrong ends: 4 (one example smbd starts talking through the speaker)

audio has artifacts like papers, coughing, mic clipping, touching/hitting the speaker table

one case of early timestamp due to audio cutting from recording lol, but this is not in theory important to having a voiceprint
