Faton: 
	- Am I allowed to link to the GitHub?
	- Notes on github:
	- yml file has wrong indents
	- step 3 is miss-spelled (extra t in ...metadata.py)
	- conda environment needs way more dependencies (but maybe they just didn't come with miniconda)
	- step 4 says an audio file is already downloaded for most of the files
	
Rafal:
	- Should I try to prioritise for the within-speaker pairs to be from different debates?
	- balance by gender
	- upload a new file with only relevant speakers and debates
