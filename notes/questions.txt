Faton: 
	- Am I allowed to link to the GitHub?
	- Notes on github:
	- yml file has wrong indents
	- step 3 is miss-spelled (extra t in ...metadata.py)
	- conda environment needs way more dependencies (but maybe they just didn't come with miniconda)
	- step 4 says an audio file is already downloaded for most of the files
