dokid+anforandenummer are *not* unique
	- GT01FöU12, 8
	
problems with data:
	- some speeches have an excessively large duration, because they end when the video ends, and not when the speaker stops talking (max = 7799 seconds or > 2 hours)
	- some speeches/speakers are reduplicated in the dataset, with speakers starting starting to talk multiple times around the same starting mark
	- not all "start of debates" are started at 1
	- most overlap seems to be around 60 secs (when excluding the extreme cases)
	- 176 speakers > 10 years
		- 176 speakers after combining proper speaker names
	- 25 speakers > 15 years
		- 41 speakers after combining proper speaker names
	
	- speakers in database have prefixes (e.g. "landsbygdsminister") and postfixes (e.g. (L)), but the same speaker might appear with different affixes. May have multiple prefixes ughhhh
		- tredje vice talman liselott hagberg (fp)
		- I linked speakers between the speeches and speaker metadata. This excludes some speakers cuz:
			- error or other unexpected things in their speeches name
				- walburga habsburg dougla (m) VS walburga habsburg douglas (m)
			- name change (e.g. they got married)
				- "Anna Grönlund (FP)" vs "Anna Grönlund Krantz (FP)"
	- omg some speakers don't have a birthdate in the meta file -_-
	
	- can't match two dataframes by dokid+anforande_nummer
		- see GT10325
		
	- Some text is missing? 
		- see GS01FIU20_37. Roger Tiefensee's text is *nowhere* to be found in the debates euh
		
	- text in anforanden isn't *transcribed* properly, so that makes ASR matching hard lol

notes on cleaning up data:
	- removed double dokid+anforandenummers
		- wrong annotation, painful to deal with
	- removed speakers whose name could not be extracted
		- because then I couldn't find their birthyear
	- removed speakers without a birthyear
	- removed speakers active for < 10 years
	- only kept speeches where nr_speech_segments == 1.0
		- takes care of at least 2 files where the speaker is wrong
		- related to diarisation, something among the lines of "how many remaining speech segments there were within this clip". I still need to go through this a couple of times to understand it
	- removed speeches without a valid audio
	- kept speeches where 0.7 <= length_ratio <= 1.3
		- length_ratio = how much longer/shorter the speech segments predicted by diarisation are compared to those predicted by ASR
	- kept speeches where 0.7 <= overlap_ratio <= 1.3
		 - of the time covered by the ASR prediction, how much of that does diarisation cover? Goes between 0 for no overlap to 1 for 100% overlap
	- removed speeches where speakers mention themselves
		- I figure it is unlikely speakers do so, and this is related to wrong annotation
	- removed speeches shorter than 20 secs
	- removed speeches that didn't follow each other linearly, as that caused diarisation issues
		- e.g. GS01UBU3_139 and GS01UBU3_138: 139 was before 138, but the timestamp associated with 139 came after 138, but the speaker was *not* correct

		6186   christer nylander               140    5647.598438
		- mostly related to wrong annotation that this took care of
		- also took care of speeches that would otherwise have overlapped each other significantly (i.e. one speech containing the other)
	- no year had a speaker with no activity
	
Sometimes speeches are cut up:
