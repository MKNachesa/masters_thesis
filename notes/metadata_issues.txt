dokid+anforandenummer are *not* unique
	- GT01FöU12, 8
	
problems with data:
	- some speeches have an excessively large duration, because they end when the video ends, and not when the speaker stops talking (max = 7799 seconds or > 2 hours)
	- some speeches/speakers are reduplicated in the dataset, with speakers starting starting to talk multiple times around the same starting mark
	- not all "start of debates" are started at 1
	- most overlap seems to be around 60 secs (when excluding the extreme cases)
	- 176 speakers > 10 years
		- 176 speakers after combining proper speaker names
	- 25 speakers > 15 years
		- 41 speakers after combining proper speaker names
	
	- speakers in database have prefixes (e.g. "landsbygdsminister") and postfixes (e.g. (L)), but the same speaker might appear with different affixes. May have multiple prefixes ughhhh
		- tredje vice talman liselott hagberg (fp)
		- I linked speakers between the speeches and speaker metadata. This excludes some speakers cuz:
			- error or other unexpected things in their speeches name
				- walburga habsburg dougla (m) VS walburga habsburg douglas (m)
			- name change (e.g. they got married)
				- "Anna Grönlund (FP)" vs "Anna Grönlund Krantz (FP)"
	- omg some speakers don't have a birthdate in the meta file -_-
	
	- can't match two dataframes by dokid+anforande_nummer
		- see GT10325
		
	- Some text is missing? 
		- see GS01FIU20_37. Roger Tiefensee's text is *nowhere* to be found in the debates euh
		
	- text in anforanden isn't *transcribed* properly, so that makes ASR matching hard lol

notes on cleaning up data:
	- removed double dokid+anforandenummers
	- removed speakers whose name could not be extracted
	- removed speakers without a birthyear
	- removed speakers active for < 10 years
	- removed speeches where nr_speech_segments = NaN
	- only kept speeches where nr_speech_segments == 1.0
		- takes care of at least 2 files where the speaker is wrong
	- removed speeches without a valid audio
	- kept speeches where 0.7 <= length_ratio <= 1.3
	- kept speeches where 0.7 <= overlap_ratio <= 1.3
	- removed speeches where speakers mention themselves
	- removed speeches shorter than 20 secs
	- try to filter out speeches that overlap with each other?
		- see GR01TU10_89 and GR01TU10_90
		- first, remove speeches that do not monotonically follow each other, e.g., GS01UBU3_139 and GS01UBU3_138 (names there are wrong as well). See if this fixes self-naming issue
	- no year had a speaker with no activity
	
Sometimes speeches are cut up:
