Effects of age on the amplitude, frequency and perceived quality of voice (Lortie et al., 2015)
	- Age affects the voice, but "the ability to increase/decrease the amplitute and frequency of voice are preserved, at least in the age range studied"
	- i.e., voice differences are primarily observed not in connected speech. These differences are mostly observed in sustained vowels. Even mean F0 doesn't change in connected speech? Wild
	
Notes on github:
	- yml file has wrong indents
	- step 3 is miss-spelled (extra t in ...metadata.py)
	- conda environment needs way more dependencies (but maybe they just didn't come with miniconda)
	- step 4 says an audio file is already downloaded for most of the files
